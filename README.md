# BestAlbums
Data analytics of Rolling Stone magazine's lists of best albums of all time in 2003 and 2020

The BestAlbums project has as objective to analyse the data from the 2003 and 2020 Rolling Stone magazine's lists of the best albums of all time and then to discover data insights related.

## Data collecting from Discogs API
The first part of this project is to build a dataset with some selected atributes from the albums in the lists. So, I did Python script in Jupyter Notebook named 'dataCollecting.ipynb'. In this code I used webscrapping to get the album lists from the Discogs website and then I used the Discogs API to get the albums atributes. Some Python libraries were used mainly the BeautifulSoup to manipulate HTML tags.

### Disclaim
As I am not a data scientist yet, so maybe the coding need to be improved. So, I'll be grateful if you, Python Master, be patient and help me to get better =)
